### Canonical course description

A study of the fundamental concepts that arise in different programming language paradigms. Students learn how programming languages 
are designed and implemented, and how these factors affect the overall usability, performance, and effectiveness of computer software. 
Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students gain experience in leveraging the styles and features of 
programming languages to implement and evaluate correct and efficient computer software. During a weekly laboratory session, students 
use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. 
Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for 
use during class and lab sessions.

Prerequisite: `CMPSC 101` or `CMPSC 102`.

Distribution Requirements: `QR`, `SP`.

#### Distribution requirements

##### `QR`

Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of how to interpret numeric data and/or their 
graphical or symbolic representations.

##### `SP`

Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of the nature, approaches, and domain of scientific inquiry.

### Course learning objectives

* Correctly identify and describe the steps in the design and implementation of a programming language. [`QR`, `SP`]
* Effectively use programming language constructs to design correct, efficient, and well-tested programs in multiple programming languages, including but not limited to Java. [`QR`, `SP`]
* Interpret and use an existing programming language grammar. [`QR`]
* Design, implement, and evaluate a correct scanner and parser for a programming language. [`QR`, `SP`]
* Using knowledge of the general principles of programming languages, correctly implement a computer program in a heretofore unknown programming language. [`QR`, `SP`]
